    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanical modelling tends to be a very complex mathematical task.One of the most important problems realted to modelling probability in mechanics is to find the reliabity of materials that are used to build objects. A lot of research has taken place to compute fatigue effects on materials and structures.There have been a lot of developments in this area after the proposal Paris' Law. Most of the models proposed realted to fatigue crack propogation are deterministic and have some limitations such as that they arise from arbitary empirical assumptions.A proper estimation of fatigue crack porpogation rates with respect to residual stress and stress ratio helps us to estimate optimal materials for mechanical tasks. For e.g. : To determine the type of steel to be used when we are building a bridge. Proper estimation of fatigue crack proporgation and finding its probabilisitic curves also gives great insights to the propertiees of material and can be useful when the material is being improved, i.e. at the time of development on newer types of alloys. \n",
    "\n",
    "The First breakthrough in the field of fatigue propogation estimation was the Paris' Law which was followed by various approaches[3].Initially Local strain-based approches were proposed to model fatigue crack propogation on notch based components further a link was established between local strain-based approached to fatigue and Frature mechanics based fatigue crack propogation models.[1,5-10] As research continued models were proposed that using residual stress concepts ecplained stress ratio effects as well as interaction effects on crack growth rates.Several approches were proposed which were analytical and or numerical.[11-14]The underlying concept behind the proposed local approaches for fatigue crack propagation modelling consists of assuming fatigue crack propagation as a process of continuous failure of consecutive representative material elements (continuous re-initializations). Such a kind of approaches has been demonstrated to correlate fatigue crack propagation data from several sources, including the stress ratio effects[10-14]. The crack tip stress-strain fields are computed using elastoplastic analysis, which are applied together a fatigue damage law to predict the failure of the representative material elements. The simplified method of Neuber[15]  or Moftakhar[16] et al. may be used to compute the elastoplastic stress field at the crack tip vicinity using the elastic stress distribution given by the Fracture Mechanics.[1,16-17]  One Such model (given by Noorzi)[1,10-11] the unigrow model, modelled the fatigue crack growth based on elastic–plastic crack tip stress–strain history regarded the process of fatigue crack propogation as a process of successive crack re-initiation in the crack tip region. [1][0]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the unigrow model and extend it to relate it with a probabilistic contruct to find probabilistic fatigue crack propagation rates various materials. The Unigrow model to derive probabilistic fatigue crack propogation $da/dN-\\bigtriangleup K$ fields for a particular selected material ((S355) structural mild steel)[0], for distinct stress ratios.The Deterministic model uses Morrows equation, Strain life relation along with the SWT relation to model parameters deterministically.For Probabilistic approach the strain-life field proposed by Castillo and Fernandez-Canteli [20] and Shane-Watson-Topper-life field [0] which are based on Weibull Distribution are used to generalize the results to account for mean stress effects using percentile curves. The simulation was modelled using the data acquired[19,0] and was further extended where we tried to make a prediction model for Threshold value of life time[N0], Endurance limit of strain [E0], Fatigue Limit of SWT parameter[SWT] and the Weibull parameters(lambda(Position),delta(Scale),Beta(Shape)) by Running Batch Gradient Descent[Reference to ML Glossary] on Loss function from [27] and further using probability-weighted moments from [27] to predict N0,E0,SWT and Weibull parameters. The Probabilistic Life time fields are combined with Unigrow model [0-1] to finally compute the probabilistic fatigue crack proppogation field for distinct stress ratios. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The current deterministic works take into account a lot of parameters and some of these parameters cannot be determined easily or at all and hence these works take arbitary assumptions in the process of modelling. To solve this (Our Base Article) proposes a probabilistic model that not only arises from sound statistical and physical assumtions, it also manages to provide a probabilistic definiton of the whole strain-life field. Further, since mechanical modelling is a complex task and takes into account a lot of parameters, we have tried to simplify the process of finding probabilistic fatigue crack propogation fields.Not only this we have tried to use Gradient Descent Regression and Probability-weighted moments method to estimate certain parameters required for the task.\n",
